    Graphics Project is an annual series of lectures, discussions, and <br>
    portfolio reviews exploring the role of graphic design within the <br>
    field of architecture organized by <strong>Yoonjai Choi</strong>.
</p>

<p>
    We examine various methods of visual communication used to <br>
    convey concepts to both specialist and general audiences. These <br>
    events aim to help students build a successful graduation portfolio <br>
    while simultaneously unpacking the topics, tools, and trends of <br>
    contemporary graphic design. Past workshop recordings and <br>
    additional resources are available on the Graphics Project Webpage. 
</p>
<p>
    Graphics Project Workshops are open to all current GSAPP Students. <br>
    Both lectures on this date will occur in the same meeting. <br>
    Details on day 2 presentations here.
